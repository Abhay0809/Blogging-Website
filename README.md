## üöÄ Get Up and Running

You can get a react-blog site up and running on your local dev environment with these five steps:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher

```

### 1. From your command line, clone and run react-blog-github:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/username/Blogging-Website.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Blogging-Website

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

```

### 2. **Generate a Github Personal Access Token.**

Generate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) `Make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token without any scope`

After that copy your generated token and then encode your token into base 64 using this [Website](http://www.utilities-online.info/base64/)

`Copy your base64 converted token`

### 3. Create a GitHub App (Optional if you want to host on GitHub)

Go on the following URL: https://github.com/settings/apps/new

There are a few fields to fill carefully:
- Homepage URL: https://your_username.github.io/react-blog-github/
- Callback URL: https://your_username.github.io/react-blog-github/
- Check "Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation"

In permissions & events, set `Read & Write` on Issues
In "Install App", install the app on your user and select your repository

### 4. **Change `/src/config.js`.**
Go to your cloned repository and make the following changes in `/src/config.js`

```javascript
export const config = {
  // Your Github Converted Token To Know How To Get Your Token Look at Readme.md
  githubConvertedToken: "Your token here",

  // Your Github UserName
  githubUserName: "Your username here",

  // Your Github Repo Name Where You Have your issues as Blog
  githubRepo: "Your repo's name here",

  // Set it to true if you have a Github app to add to this project
  // and fill the client ID & secret
  enableOAuth: true,
  OAuthClientID: 'Github App Client ID',
  OAuthSecret: 'Github App Secret',

  // Your Personal Blog Title
  title : "Title of your blog" ,

  // Your Personal Blog Subtitle
  subtitle : "Subtitle of your blog",

  // Header customization
  header: {
    backgroundColor: '#f1f6f8', // can be a CSS gradient
    titleColor: '#ff5252',
    subtitleColor: '#37474f',
  },
};
```

### 5. **Write A Blog.**
After doing following changes now you just need to write a blog on repository issues that you have mentioned in your `config.js`

- Open your repository [github issues](https://github.com/Abhay2611/Blogging-Website/issues)
- Create a new issue 
- Now write your blog in github issue in markdown. You can also use [slack edit](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write your markdown
- Add a label `blog` on your github issue to make it different from other standard issues. Keep in mind `blog` label is mandatory otherwise it won't show on your website.

### 6. **Start Your React App.**
That's it now you just need to start your react application From your command line run . 

```bash
# Run
$ npm start

```
